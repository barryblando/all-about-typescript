# Typescript

## Why do we care about types

- Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase

## Where do we use types

- Everywhere in application, Every value you define

## Type Annotation & Inference

- Annotation(`Developer Side`): Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
  - Use when you declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
  - Use when you want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
  - Use when a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
- Inference(`Compiler Side`): Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
  - Rely whenever necessary

  ```ts
    declaration       initialization
    -----^-----           --^--
    const color     =     'red'
  ```

  - if declaration and initialization are on the same line, Typescript will figure out the type of 'color' for us

## Gradual Typing

- Typescript typing system typically lies somewhere in-between Static and Dynamic Typing

  ```js
  let name = "John";
  ```

   If you hover over the variable name in the playground, youâ€™ll see that TypeScript managed to associate name with the string variable. In fact, TypeScript provides type inference as well.

  ```ts
    let sum: (a:any, b:any) => any <- avoid any as much as possible
  ```

   In this case, TypeScript didnâ€™t associate a particular type to either **a** , **b** or the return value of sum . The types of the sum functionâ€™s arguments or return could be anything. These types will be determined in runtime when executing the function. This is due to the **'+'** operator, which is not specific to any particular type in TypeScript or JavaScript.

   **Conclusion:**

   In a gradually-typed language such as TypeScript, some declarations will have their types checked during compile-time and others will have their types checked at run-time.
